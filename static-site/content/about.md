Empowering devs to easily bootstrap a Kubernetes DevOps/GitOps complete environment and pipelines using a minimal (and free of charge) k3s cluster.


The main idea is to have an easilly deployable (and pseudo production-ready) setup that can be used for dev/test, or as a homelab for tool testing and learning purposes.
